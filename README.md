<h1>Network Scanner</h1>

This is a very basic, menu-driven network scanner that can achieve the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Port Scanning</li>
<li>Banner Grabbing</li>
<li>OS Detection</li>
<li>Ping Scanning</li>
</ul> 

Feel free to fork and create pull requests and contribute to this project. The original purpose of this repo was a personal project. You can use this as an intro to networking using python.
